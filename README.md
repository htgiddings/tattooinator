A Mac export of CmarNYC's Tattooinator for the Sims 3.  Based off the original C# code generously provided by CmarNYC themselves.

A note from CmarNYC:
I'd be happy to share my source code with you for this or any other tool! However, there's problems with this particular one. I wrote Tattooinator ages ago in Fortran using a platform that gives Windows UI support, and I don't have that code on my current computer. I'm pretty sure I have it backed up somewhere, and I'll look for it if you think it would be helpful.

I did rewrite Tattooinator a couple of years ago in C#, stopped for reasons I don't remember, got distracted, and never released it. It works, though, and I really should do a little final testing and release it since the old one probably doesn't run so well on newer versions of Windows.
